# BullCowGame
Unreal Engine 4.22 Project for Bull Cow Game, written in C++.

## Introduction
Hello! Thank you for taking a look at my Github page. I created the Bull Cow game as my first game in the Unreal Engine and I decided to share it on Github. I hope that in future I can make more complex games but so far I have learnt a lot about game design. Learning how to construct game loops was particularly insightful because it allows you as a software engineer to check the logic at each stage of the player's potential decisions through your game. Furthermore, whilst I have done C++ for over a year, I was completely unfamiliar with the libraries in Unreal Engine that allow you to interact with an environment. I am beginning to have a new found appreciation for Triple-A game designers!
